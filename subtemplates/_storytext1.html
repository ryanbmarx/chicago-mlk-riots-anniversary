<p>Betty Johnson, 17, was chatting with friends at a going-away party when a TV broadcast abruptly interrupted the get-together with a tumultuous scene from Chicago’s West Side.</p>
<p>It was Friday, April 5, 1968, one day after Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated. Johnson, who lived in the Fifth City neighborhood, was in a panic to get home.</p>
<p>When she arrived at her house in the <span id='betty-home' class='map-waypoint'>3500 block of West Van Buren Street</span>, she was stunned, aghast, dumbfounded, terrified (strong descriptor here).</p>
<p>Her block was engulfed in flames and heavy black smoke. National guardsmen were fanning out across the street with rifles fixed with bayonets. Her mother, sweating from the heat of the fire, was corralling some of her 10 siblings and urgently packing their station wagon with canned food and clothing. From the roof of their two-flat, her father and brothers, armed with a garden hose, were trying to quell the inferno from a neighboring building as its walls began to crumble and collapse onto theirs.</p>

<p>The fires could be seen for miles, Johnson recalls, but for her family, the peril was on their doorstep.</p>
<p>Two days later, only ash and rubble remained along a <span id='madison-street' class='map-waypoint'>2-mile stretch of Madison Street, and some areas of Roosevelt Road and 63rd Street.</span> The majority of residents who took no part in the destruction were left to return to their daily lives amid the ruin. Many believed their neighborhoods would be rebuilt. But today — a half century later — much of those corridors are still devastated.</p>
<p>After scouring hundreds of archived stories and historic photos, the Tribune found North Lawndale and East Garfield Park in particular, look almost exactly as they did 50 years ago. Reporters spoke with unbowed residents, retired police officers, acknowledged rioters, civil rights leaders, historians and public officials to seek perspective on a disturbing question: Why are pockets of the West Side still decimated?</p>

After scouring hundreds of archived stories and historic photos, the Tribune found Lawndale and East Garfield Park in particular, look almost exactly as they did 50 years ago. In interviews with residents, retired police officers, acknowledged rioters, civil rights leaders, historians and public officials, reporters discovered both despondence and indefatigability. But answers to why parts of the West Side are still abandoned remain elusive.</p>
<p>While only 5 percent of Chicago is classified as vacant or undeveloped, approximately 14 percent of land sits idle in the community areas of East Garfield Park and North Lawndale, according to a 2013 land-use inventory from the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. </p>
<p>“After the riots came, everything just stayed just like it was,” Johnson said. “It was just a desert. Nothing was here. Just lots of vacant lots.”</p>

<p>Gone were the local businesses: Imperial theater; Rosenau Jewelers; Brotman’s Clothing Store; Frank’s Furniture House; Beesen Hardware. Most of the institutions that burned down never returned. Vacant lots, the grass bleached brown, boarded-up buildings and barren swaths of pavement now scar the neighborhood. They collect wrappers, cigarette butts and empty bottles of all kinds. Little except for a flicker of hope remains here – that and liquor stores, social services agencies and a few check-cashing joints.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Sen. Fred Harris, a member of the Kerner commission that studied the riots that plagued American cities in the 1960s, recently visited Chicago and observed the desolation in parts of the West Side.</p>
<p>"It's like cities like New Orleans, where they suffered a natural disaster, Katrina,” said Harris, comparing the man-made destruction in neighborhoods like North Lawndale and East Garfield Park to the aftermath of a hurricane.</p>
<p>The issues affecting these communities are more than cosmetic. In some ways, select sections of black Chicago are worse off today than they were in 1968, data compiled by Chicago demographer Rob Paral show.</p>

<p>Over five decades, the East Garfield Park and North Lawndale communities have lost two-thirds of their population as nearly anyone with means has left for the suburbs or other areas of the city. </p>
<p>Those who remain are poorer now, too, with close to half of the residents in both neighborhoods living below the poverty level.</p>
<p>In East Garfield Park, the community area hardest hit by the riots, the median household income was nearly $31,000 in 1970; it was just under $24,000 in 2016. In North Lawndale, the backdrop of the Roosevelt Road riots, median income fell within the same period — from nearly $37,000 to just under $24,000, all adjusted for inflation.</p>
<p>While academics and public officials are split on the how to solve some of these enduring issues, nearly all agree part of Chicago’s West Side were nearly destroyed after 72 hours of rage following King’s death. Some never recovered.</p>
<h3>The riots</h3>
<p>The morning of April 5, 1968, started quietly. It was a sunlit Friday as springtime weather had started to take hold and green grass had just begun to poke through the West Side lawns.</p>
<p>The calm initially convinced police they might escape the day without major incident. By mid-morning, small bands of a few dozen young people, mainly of high school age, marched on the Civic Center and on State and Madison streets in the Loop.</p>

<p>Within an hour, windows were being broken in six stores on Madison between State and LaSalle streets. Extra police were called in to disperse the crowds.  By 2 p.m., the police chief requested the assistance of the national guard. Thirty minutes later, the first fire had broken out at a furniture store in the 2300 block of West Madison on the Near West Side.</p>
<p>As Chicago police Patrolman Frederick Pirjevec started his 3 p.m. shift, fires were raging along Madison street. Pijevec, 32, a product of war-torn Slovenia, was largely unfazed as the billowing smoke signaled destruction and the radio buzzed with shootings.</p>
<p>QUOTE FROM PIRJEVIC AT THE SCENE</p>
<p>When Pirjevec first came to the United States, he struggled to comprehend segregation, racism and the struggle for civil rights. </p>
<p>Those from poor black neighborhoods, like Randall Harris of Lawndale, knew and understood these problems well. Harris, now a pastor at a Lawndale church, admits he set fires on Roosevelt Road during the raucous unrest after King’s death. Then 18, he grew up admiring King and his principles.</p>
<p>“It’s like if you came home and your parents were gone, somebody killed your parents,” Harris, now 68, said of the mood. “What would you — how would you feel?”</p>
<p>Someone would pay for King’s murder, he and his friends decided that night, as they raced into the eye of the storm. </p>
<p>A Chicago fire department spokesman said the west side was like
 a wartime city under siege and said it looked like a million fires were burning.
-- April 7, 1968, Tribune report</p>
<p>During the worst of the crisis, more than 2,000 fireman and 100 pieces of fire apparatus were fighting the blazes. Police officers worked in groups to guard the firefighters, who were being harassed by youths throwing rocks and bottles. </p>
<p>A thousand sanitation workers were also on the West Side, helping firemen move hoses and debris. More than 6,000 guardsmen were mobilized and sent into riot areas. Police were on 12-hour shifts in an effort to marshal more manpower. At the height of the rioting there were 2,500 policeman on duty.  </p>

<p>Then Mayor Richard J. Daley gave police the authority to “shoot to kill” arsonists and “shoot to maim” looters. Less than a year before, in response to riots besieging cities like Detroit and Newark, Daley had said it was “impossible for Chicago to go up in smoke,” according to Tribune reports.</p>
<p>On Saturday, April, 6, looters returned to the streets where fearful business owners had boarded up their storefronts. Some black shop owners scrawled “Soul Brother” on hastily made signs that hung their windows, hoping the message would spare them.</p>
<p>But West Madison and Roosevelt were hit hard for a second night. </p>
