<p>At least nine people were killed during the rioting and another 300 were hurt. All told, 260 stores and businesses were destroyed, including 116 along a 20-block stretch of Madison between Damen Avenue and Pulaski Road. Another 72 were razed within 12 blocks of Roosevelt. </p>
<p>Although disturbances had also broken out on the South and Near North sides, the West Side took the brunt of the damage. Estimates for rebuilding were pegged between $9 million and $10 million; much of it uninsured.</p>
<p>In the days after riots, bulldozers cleared away the wreckage. Federal troops and guardsmen left the city. Residents were left to try to sort out their futures.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of the residents of those areas - the decent people - did not participate,” Superintendent Conlisk said. “They only suffered.”

Northern migration
In the 1950s and 1960s, the West Side was the new frontier for blacks migrating from the South.</p>

<p>It was regarded as a vibrant area filled with jobs and opportunity. After all, it was home to Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Ryerson Steel. International Harvester was due south and General Electric was in nearby Cicero. Businesses were plentiful and prosperous, and retail arteries like Madison and Roosevelt fed a thriving economy.</p>
<p>It was like this when Johnson and her family moved into their East Garfield Park home in 1958. She said they had been the first black family in the neighborhood. As an 8-year-old girl, she walked to school with a white friend and the girl’s father, passing by the promenade of businesses on Fifth Avenue: the corner tavern, a cleaners, restaurants, grocery stores. The family of 13 finally had much-needed breathing room in the two-flat, where the kids slept in stacked bunk beds in the basement. The only vacant lot at the time, just next door, was an amenity — kids like Johnson played softball there.</p>
<p>Incoming black residents, however, also had to contend with racism, even though white families were quickly leaving the area.</p>
<p>“Oh my God, they threw eggs at the door when we first moved here, they set garbage on fire, they wrote n----r on the glass door. They harassed us really good,” said Johnson, who turned activist in her youth, regularly joining marches and street protests. “There was a lot of build up. That’s why the movement was so powerful back then. We were realizing the things were being kept from us.”</p>
<p>One of those things was equal access to housing. To discourage black families from settling in an area, some selling homes would offer “contract” agreements, requiring prospective black buyers to put down lots of cash to buy a home on contract but without the equity assured by an actual mortgage. The practice was a response to lenders’ refusal to give mortgage loans in black communities.</p>
<p>“They couldn’t outright get a mortgage,” Johnson said, describing her parents experience. “They gave them contracts. You had to pay so much on contract before you go to mortgage.”
In East Garfield Park, the black population exploded from 11,675 in 1950 to 41,097 in 1960 to 51,128 in 1970. Meanwhile, the white population was headed in the other direction, even before the 1968 riots: 58,144 in 1950, 25,409 in 1960 and only 885 in 1970.</p>
<p>“The numbers of white people who, within just a few years, said, ‘I'm out of here’ is just stunning,” demographer Rob Paral said. “That's a lot of people in 10 years, that’s (roughly) 2,300 people every year.” </p>
<p>This white flight was brought on by prejudice from those who didn’t want to live near African-Americans. Much of it was also enabled by the advent of the interstate highway system in the ‘50s and government programs that gave rise to suburbia. </p>
<p>“We started to subsidize the movement of middle class people to the suburbs,” Paral said. “That is a factor, you can’t blame it all on the riots. White people were essentially being paid by their government to move to suburbs.”</p>
<p>Many city services went with them, and housing conditions declined as more blacks were renting homes in Chicago. </p>
<p>In 1970, of the 240,000 housing units rented by black tenants, more than 5 percent lived without some or all plumbing, according to Census figures. A significant portion lacked complete kitchen facilities.</p>

<h3>The struggle</h3>

In 1966, two years before he was felled by a sniper’s bullet, King had taken his campaign for equality from Selma, Ala., to Chicago, saying the city “epitomizes all of the problems found in urban centers of the North.”</p>
<div class='graphic-fpo'>

</div>

<p>King moved into a dingy, $90-a-month apartment inside a three-story building at 1550 S. Hamlin Ave. There was no lock on the front door, the entryway had dirt floors, a dim bulb at the head of rickety stairs and the overwhelming smell of urine. Inside the two-bedroom unit, the family had no stove or refrigerator, and the tile floors were cracked.</p>
<p>King and his organization took over an apartment building at 1321 S. Homan Ave., encouraging its residents to use their monthly rent to rehabilitate the building. He marched in protest of housing segregation in the white enclave of Marquette Park on Chicago’s Southwest Side. He also joined forces with a Chicago-based organizer named Jesse Jackson who he entrusted to lead programs aimed at spurring economic development in black communities. </p>
<p>“This is the first urban city that had that kind of progress,” Jackson, 76, said, speaking recently from the headquarters of his Rainbow/PUSH organization on the South Side. “We changed the minds of what was possible in Chicago and gave a signal to urban America of what was possible … Much of the movement's gravitational center was in Chicago.”</p>
<p>King’s efforts endeared him to black communities in Chicago.</p>
<p>“King really had a special place with us on the West Side,” said Randall Harris, the Lawndale pastor. “We had a real relationship with him. It wasn’t like we heard about him, we actually got a chance to hear him preach, touch him, those kinds of things. He went into the pool halls and the various institutions, and we were able to interact with him.”</p>
<p>But life in Lawndale also impacted King and his family, as he wrote in his last book:</p>
<p>“The crowded flat in which we lived was about to produce an emotional explosion
in my own family. It was just too hot, too crowded, too devoid of creative forms
 of recreation. There was just not space enough in the neighborhood to run off the energy
 of childhood without running into busy, traffic-laden streets. And I understood anew the conditions which make of the ghetto an emotional pressure cooker.”</p>
<p>Similar conditions gave rise to rioting in Los Angeles, Baltimore, Newark and Detroit in 1967. </p>

<p>Fred Harris was one of 11 members of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, eventually known as the Kerner commission, for its chairman, Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner. After months of study, visits to former riot cities and hours of testimony from public figures including King, the commission issued a scathing report in March 1968 condemning “white racism” for creating, maintaining, and condoning America’s ghettos. </p>
<p>It famously advised that America was “moving toward two societies, one black, one white — separate and unequal.” The findings were largely sensationalized by media and dismissed by government officials.</p>
<p>Weeks later, King traveled to Memphis, Tenn., with Jackson by his side to support a movement for sanitation workers. As King stood on a second-floor balcony at the Lorraine Motel, he was shot by escaped convict James Earl Ray, an Illinois native.</p>
<p>His assassination set off more than 100 riots across the U.S., including the most devastating civil disturbance in Chicago’s history. It also generated uncertainty about the future of the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>“It was like, where do we go from here?” Jackson said. “We were not going to let one bullet stop a movement. He would not dare let us stop our work because he had been shot. It’s like playing big game and the team captain gets hurt. You don't forfeit the game. You have to get your nerves together and regroup.”</p>

<p>King’s death was gut-wrenching for West Siders like Johnson who looked at him as the movement’s messiah. He joined an astonishing list of civil rights champions of the 1960s who were killed or died unexpectedly. John F. Kennedy and Malcolm X had already been killed by the time King was fatally shot; Bobby Kennedy was also gunned down in 1968. Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, was fatally shot during a police raid in 1969.</p>
<p>Each passing eroded the community’s faith that one day life in poor, black communities could improve. The deaths, some argue, left the civil rights movement without critical leadership, fragmenting it in a way many thought was irreparable.</p>
<p>“I think that a generation of people felt like they lost hope, that there was nobody to fight for them anymore,” Johnson said.
Repeating history
Fifty years after King’s death, academics are once again examining what progress has been made since the Kerner Report. Recent rioting in cities such as Baltimore, Ferguson, Mo., and Milwaukee has brought renewed attention to the long simmering and unsolved problems of segregation, poverty and police violence.</p>
<p>“We’ve studied these problems to death,” said Fred Harris. “It isn’t for lack of knowing the facts and the causes of the troubles and the remedies for them — we know all that. We don’t need another (Kerner) commission to tell us what those facts are. Instead what we need is a creation of will, enough will and political clout to get some of these things done.”</p>
<p>Today, the East Garfield Park and North Lawndale community areas are smaller, poorer and less diverse. The combined population is 55,600, 71 percent less than it was in 1960. Nearly 89 percent of residents are black and 43 percent live below the poverty line.</p>
<p>On a recent chilly weekday afternoon, cars parked on a grassy lot near Roosevelt and St. Louis Avenue. Nearby an overturned bucket, a milk crate and a weathered office chair created a makeshift living room for a few people drinking outdoors. Across the street, people walked across another littered lot where years of plodding feet had created a footpath.</p>
<p>A few blocks away, an older man remembered the stories of his mother who enjoyed shopping in the business district. </p>
<p>“This used to be like downtown,” he said as he shuffled past a long-shuttered record store and pastures of weeds and garbage.</p>
<p>Roshonda Williams, a lifelong resident of North Lawndale, never had a chance to experience those days. Williams, 32, has only ever known a desolate and decayed Roosevelt Road. She barely acknowledged the trash-filled lots as she strode past them on a March afternoon.</p>
<p>“It’s been like this for as long as I’ve been growing up,” Williams said. “I always wondered why.”</p>

<p>She’s certain she wants better for her 6-year-old daughter. One day, she hopes they’ll be able to leave the blighted area for somewhere with more promise.
Stymied progress
West Side residents attribute much of the stagnation to real estate companies that have purchased swaths of land over the decades with no intention of redeveloping them. </p>
<p>The city prosecutes owners of abandoned buildings when they become havens for crime or an eyesore, and hundreds of properties are currently under forfeiture and slated for demolition. </p>
<p>Once land becomes vacant, its owner is obligated to do little more than pay taxes and maintain it, which includes keeping it free of litter. But the penalties, ranging from $300 to $1,200 a day, don’t appear to be much of a deterrent in communities rife with refuse. </p>
<p>The city also owns more than 1,700 parcels of vacant land in North Lawndale and East Garfield Park.</p>
<p>In recent years, city programs gave community members and nonprofits the opportunity to buy multiple parcels of vacant lots on their block for $1 or for a discounted price. A University of Illinois study on one of the initiatives shows residents generally handle the upkeep. But most don’t have the means to revitalize the land, outside of community gardens or side yards. </p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Danny Davis said he located his offices in the 2800 block of Fifth Avenue “to be at the center of need.” His office is surrounded by vacant lots, many filled with an obscene amount of litter, including used diapers, broken CDs, and food and drink wrappers.</p>
<p>Some development has been stymied by landowners who set lofty prices that developers aren’t willing to pay, Davis said. For that reason, more investment is needed from all quarters of government to impel business owners to build west of Western Avenue, he said. </p>
<p>Even when millions of dollars in public money was allocated, somehow the West Side communities were still left with close to nothing.  Perhaps the most memorable financial collapse occurred during the late-1970s to mid-1980s when Pyramidwest Development Corp. received $22 million in federal funds for a slew of projects intended to revitalize the West Side, including a couple of blocks of burned-out land near Kedzie Avenue and Roosevelt. </p>
<p>Projects included a shopping plaza, an industrial park and affordable housing. After more than a decade, townhouses and senior housing were built. But no economic redevelopment was generated beyond a bank. The land intended to be a shopping plaza was later surrendered to its previous owners after Pyramidwest failed to keep up with property taxes. </p>
<p>Through it all, some stay.</p>
<p>“In almost any poverty stricken area, you find a lot of young people who can’t get house where they live. You find a lot of old people who can’t start anew someplace else, and they can’t just get another mortgage or decide to rebuild their entire existence. The others have kind of dug in,’’ Davis said. “They are people you find on almost every block who say, ‘This is where I am. This is my home.’”

<h3>Returning home</h3></p>
<p>Betty Johnson’s house was still standing after the fires and riots subsided, and her family continued to live there despite the neighborhood ruin. She went to college and moved away for many years. But in 1982, Johnson decided to move back home. </p>
<p>When she returned, the neighborhood was even more empty than when she had left, and it had become a hotbed for crime.</p>
<p>Standing in a vacant lot behind her two-flat recently, Johnson, now 66, fondly recalled the days before the riots, a time when she could visit restaurants on Madison Street during her lunch period at Marshall High School, when her family had a choice of three grocery stores within a mile and when a teenager could easily find a job in her own community. </p>
<p>These days, ordinary tasks become an expedition. To grocery shop or visit her bank, Johnson travels at least a mile away.</p> 
<p>Strangers regularly gather on the vacant lots to drink. Police chases often send people darting past her house.</p>
<p>In April 2017, six men in their 20s were shot on her block, two of whom were killed. Johnson had seen the altercation and a man running with a gun before heading to the grocery store. She returned to find a bullet hole in her window.</p>
<p>“None of those people lived over here, but they came over here every day like they were going to work.”</p>
<p>Johnson and her neighbors formed a block club to draft solutions. They regularly called police, attended CAPS meetings and, in return, they were met with retaliatory gunfire that shattered the windows of their homes and cars.</p>
<p>Eventually, they fenced off lots whether they owned them or not, which put an end to some loitering and unwanted foot traffic. They implemented permit parking, lobbied for speed bumps and are negotiating converting the street to one way. </p>
<p>People often ask Johnson why she stays. She tells them that she initially couldn’t see a life for herself here, and she doesn’t blame people like her son who don’t want to return. But reflecting on the what her parents had to endure to buy their home -- the redlining, the harassment and financial exploitation -- she realized what it meant to own it.</p>
<p>Since that time, the woman who once challenged inequality with the likes of teacher-turned-activist Al Raby and gospel singer Mahalia Jackson has staged a silent protest in her own backyard.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to run over me, and you’re not going to run me out of here.”</p>
